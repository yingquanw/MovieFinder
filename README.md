# Movie Finder
Type anything you want to search in the search bar and I will provide you with related movies!<br>

This is my first web app! It is simple but it got my to practice a lot of the stuff I learned. <br>

Some things I did in this project:
- Getting movie information using The Movie Database (TMDB) APIs
- Manipulating DOM to add movies onto the webpage
- Using axios library to help me make request to these APIs
- Writing async javascript function to help my handle promises
- Using Bootstrap framework to help my style the webpage
